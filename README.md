# PTreceiver
Android App written in Beeware Python

This app follows the beeware structure so only the app.py and project.toml are here.  Everything else is generated by Beeware so I've not
bothered to save those here.

PTreceiver is used to open an OTG USB port and set up the port to do serial communications with a Silicon Labs USB to Xbee carrier board.
Large portions of this were borrowed from usb4a and consists of all calls into the java subsystem in the easiest way I could find.  As such
it will only work with specific Xbee carrier boards that use the Silicon Labs chipset.  I make no attempt to identify the board or check for
other types of drivers or chipsets.
