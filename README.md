# PTReceiver
Android and PC App written in Beeware Python

This app follows the beeware structure so only the app.py and project.toml are here.  Everything else is generated by Beeware so I've not
bothered to save those here.

This code has conditionals so that it runs on either the PC or an Android device.
For the PC, the standard serial port to the USB Xbee dongle is used.

For the Android implementation, this app is used to open an OTG USB port for serial communications with a Silicon Labs USB to Xbee carrier board. This is a specific app, it's used to program a custom
hardware component I designed and built, a Protothrottle dead rail receiver.

Large portions of this were borrowed from usb4a. Everything is calls into the java subsystem but it all turned out to be pretty 'pythonic'.  Combined with the easy of
use of Beeware and Briefcase to build it and the UI being built with toga, it's a very satisfying way to do python on Android.  Reminds me a lot of wx and python for windows.

Feel free to use parts and methods in your own builds. If you are doing something for a USB board other than Silicon Labs, take a look at usb4a as it has the parameters you need
for a bunch of different USB interface chips.

This was tested on a motorola moto G pure, Android 12 and Windows 11
